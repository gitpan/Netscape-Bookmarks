Netscape::Bookmarks
Kirrily 'Skud' Robert <skud@netizen.com.au>
Version 0.01 1999-09-12

This module allows you to retrieve Netscape bookmark files into
a Perl data structure (either an array or a list-of-lists).

You need HTML::Parser (well, HTML::TokeParser to be exact) to 
use this module, but that's part of the standard distribution, 
so you should be fine.

To install:

  tar -xzvf Netscape-Bookmarks-0.01.tar.gz
  cd Netscape-Bookmarks-0.01
  perl Makefile.PL
  make
  make install

A demo script (bmgrep) is included in the scripts directory.  This 
script allows you to grep your Netscape bookmarks file either by
URL or name, eg 'bmgrep -i skud' would search (case-insensitively) 
for 'Skud'.

This source code may be modified and redistributed under the same
licensing terms as Perl itself.
